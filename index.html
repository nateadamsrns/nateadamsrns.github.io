  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-blue">Exceptional Player Status</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Exceptional Player Status (EPS) is one of the most highly and honored status in all of hockey. In the CHL the exceptional status is very hard to recieve and it is only for the players that are miles in front of there age class and are ready to play at an even higher level than what they should be playing. These young talents were all very exceptional before they were in the CHL. Some of them strived in different ways on the ice and some were very similar. </i></p>

    <p>There are currently two players that were granted EPS that are playing in the CHL. Shane Wright was drafted 1st overall in the 2019 OHL draft. He is now supposed to be in his second year playing for the Kingston Frontenacs. He was given a "A" captain in his underage year in the OHL as well because he was able to set a great example of how to play hard on the ice. The second player that is currently playing the CHL that was granted EPS is Connor Bedard. He is already putting up extremly impressive numbers in just his first 7 games. He has accumilated 5 goals and 7 assists in just this little time period. I think everyone that follows north american hockey are very excited what else he has to come and what he can accomplish in the next few years until he enters the NHL draft. He was drafted 1st overall to the Regina Pats of the WHL in 2020.  </p>

    <p>Sean Day is a player that not many people remember being granted EPS because he wasn't drafted 1st overall in his OHL drafted he fell to #4 overall and he was not very impactful during his stint for the Mississauga Steelheads. He is now currently playing for the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL and is still trying to crack a NHL roster some day. Joe Veleno is the only player that was granted exceptional status in the QMJHL. He was drafted to the Saint John Seadogs 1st Overall in 2015. He had a very decent junior career for a player with exceptional status. He played a very important role for the U20 Canada Junior team who took home gold in 2019-2020. He was drafted to the Detroit Red Wings #30 in the 1st round. He has not yet played an NHL game but I wouldn't be supprised to see him playing an important role on that crumbling Detroit team in the next few years.</p>

    <p>If you are an NHL fan I am nearly certain you would know each of the three players that are currently playing in the NHL. Aaron Ekblad is currently playing for the Florida Panthers and is playing a very important role for them being there go to defenceman in any situation. He played for the Barrie Colts of the OHL and was drafted 1st overall to them. He is a 2 time NHL all-star and we can expect some more all-star apperances in the near future. The now captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs John Tavares was also granted exceptional status in the OHL and played for the Oshawa Generals. He has an exceptional resume when it comes to trophies and all he is missing is the Stanley Cup maybe he can win that with the Leafs. The last player that is currently playing in the NHL is the hands down best player in the NHL and his name is Connor McDavid. In juniors he played for the Erie Otters of the OHL and had a outstanding junior career and that jump right over as soon as he started playing for the Edmonton Oilers. </p>
